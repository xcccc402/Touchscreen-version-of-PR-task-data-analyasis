# Touchscreen version of PR task data analyasis
The 'PR_parametersSessions_ABETII_TOUCH2.19.5834.17763.py’ file helps to calculate performance parameters, including breakpoint, mean post reinforcement pause across trials (PRP_mean), mean reward collection latency across trials (RCL_mean), blank screen touch rate (BlankTouch_Rate), rate of front IR beam breaks (FIR_rate), rate of rear IR beam breaks (BIR_rate) and food magazine entry rate (MagazineEntry_Rate). Rate is calculated considering various session lengths.   
To calculate total response time for each required ratio, please run the 'PR_sequenceduration_ABETII_TOUCH2.19.5834.17763.py’ file.
The ‘PR_inter_response_interval_ABETII_TOUCH2.19.5834.17763.py’ file calculates interval between each target touch of a given trial.
